Hi, I am Avinash Swaminathan. I am currently a final-year student at Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology(NSIT), Delhi pursuing Bachelors of Engineering in Information Technology. I have had extensive research experience working as a research intern at [Multimodal Digital Media Analysis Lab , IIITD (MIDAS-IIITD)](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) under the guidance of [Dr. Debanjan Mahata](https://sites.google.com/a/ualr.edu/debanjan-mahata/) , NLP research scientist at Bloomberg and [Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/rajivratn) , assistant prof at IIITD . Here I worked on challenging NLP problems like keyphrase generation from scientific articles using GANs , natural language inference for low-resource languages like Hindi. Currently, I am working in the same research group on generating code-switched dialogues and NLP for social good. My work at IIITD has been published to premier AI conferences like AAAI , AACL-IJCNLP and EMNLP. 

My research interests are not just restricted to NLP. I am also interested in the use of Reinforcement Learning for Networking Applications and under the guidance of [Prof. Deepak Kumar Sharma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TzTXYGcAAAAJ&hl=en) of NSIT, developed a novel DRL-based routing algorithm to route packets in Software-Defined Networks. We are working on developing methods to secure such DRL-based routing algorithms against adversarial attacks. 

I have completed my industrial internship at Microsoft India Development Center as a part of the Microsoft Dataverse Team in the summer of 2020. My project involved developing unit and integration tests for MS Dataverse. Recently, I am trying my hand at Open Source Contributions and Cooking :))
I have consistently been ranked amongst top 5% of my batch and was awarded a 4-year merit scholarship for the same by NSIT. 

I am looking for researching engineering jobs specializing Deep or Machine Learning in NLP. Have a look at my [resume](https://bit.ly/3aRUavf) here. For more information, send me a mail or DM on LinkedIn.
