Hi, I am Avinash Swaminathan. I am currently a final-year student at Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology(NSIT), Delhi pursuing Bachelors of Engineering in Information Technology. My internship experience includes research internship at IIITD and software development internship at Microsoft IDC.


During my research internship at IIITD, I worked in [Multimodal Digital Media Analysis Lab , IIITD (MIDAS-IIITD)](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) under the guidance of [Dr. Debanjan Mahata](https://sites.google.com/a/ualr.edu/debanjan-mahata/) , NLP research scientist at Bloomberg and [Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/rajivratn) , assistant prof at IIITD . We concentrated on solving challenging NLP problems like keyphrase generation from scientific articles using GANs , natural language inference for low-resource languages like Hindi. Currently, I am working in the same research group on generating code-switched dialogues and NLP for social good. My work at IIITD has been published to premier AI conferences like AAAI , AACL-IJCNLP and EMNLP. 

Another area I am interested in working on is the use of Reinforcement Learning for Networking Applications. In this domain, I worked under the guidance of [Prof. Deepak Kumar Sharma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TzTXYGcAAAAJ&hl=en) of NSIT, to develop a novel DRL-based routing algorithm to route packets in Software-Defined Networks. We also carried out reasearch to build RL-based cybersecurity defense policy for Software Defined Networks. 

In Summer of 2020, I completed my software development internship at Microsoft India Development Center. I was a part of the Microsoft Dataverse Team and developed unit and integration tests for features in MS Dataverse and deployed the tested features. 

Recently, I have been trying my hand at Open Source Contributions and Cooking.

When I am not working, I usually play krunker.io, read Dan Brown novels or browse Reddit. I am also a huge Office and Breaking Bad fan. 

I will be joining Atlassian coming Fall as a Software Development Engineer working on products for teams like Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, etc.

Have a look at my [resume](https://bit.ly/3aRUavf) here for more info on my projects and grades. DM me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/AvinashSwamina2) to have a chat about NLP research or software development.
